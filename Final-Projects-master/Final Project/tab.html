Some ways to stay protected:
Using condoms when having sex (male or female but female condoms  tend to have a stronger resistance than male condoms)
Having drugs or alcohol before sex can be dangerous because you won’t be aware and might forget to protect yourself
Know your partner and who they are as a person
